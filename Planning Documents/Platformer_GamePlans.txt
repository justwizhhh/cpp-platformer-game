Games in C++ - Platformer Game - Rough Planning Notes
Dominik Heiler

---------------------------------------------------------

Basic Premise:

My platformer game will be called 'Labyrinth', and will take inspiration from early 1980s arcade games in terms of graphics and gameplay.
The game will involve exploring caverns and temples by jumping on platforms and avoiding numerous traps and enemies. The player must try
and rack up as much score as possible by exploring further into an infinitely-expanding temple and collecting coins and gems, without
losing their 3 lives. 

Features I'd like to try and code:
 - Complex player physics
   - Inspired by the original Super Mario Bros, with varying acceleration and deceleration properties for the player physics
   - Lots of float variable toggles for physics
 - Enemy object class
   - Multiple types of enemies, each with their own movement pattern(s)
   - Base class with abstract methods for movement and collision behaviours
   - Toggles for if the enemy/obstacle merely stuns or actually hurts the player, for gameplay variety
 - Infinitely-generating levels
   - Level data stored as chunks, with each chunk containing different tile position data
   - Every time the player reaches the right side of the screen, they get teleported back to the left side, and a new chunk is generated

Main game objects (might not all be implemented):
 - Player Character
 - Collectible (coin, gem, treasure chest, etc.)
 - Harmful obstacles (spikes, boulders, arrow traps)
 - Enemies (spiders, and cobras)
 - Foreground Tiles (these are processed by the player's collision detection)
 - Background Tiles (are stored separately, so as to not be detected by collision detection)

UI objects:
 - Titlescreen:
   - Title Text/Graphic
   - Menu Option Texts/Graphics
 - Main game:
   - Scoreboard Text
   - Lives Display Text
   - "Distance Travelled" Text
	- Showing the player how many level chunks they have explored so far
 - Pause screen:
   - 'Paused' Text/Graphic
   - Menu Option Texts/Graphics
 - Game over screen:
   - "Game Over" Text/Graphic
   - Menu Option Texts/Graphics
